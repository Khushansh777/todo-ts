# Todo List Application

This is a simple Todo List application built with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. It allows users to add tasks, which are then persisted in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks to your todo list.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they remain even if you close and reopen the browser.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be usable across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application, including a modern and responsive design.
- **TypeScript**: For enhanced JavaScript development, providing type safety and better code organization.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable, or create the project locally)**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd todo-TS
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies** (if you have a `package.json` with dependencies):
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use yarn
    # yarn install
    ```
3.  **Compile TypeScript**:
    This project uses TypeScript, so you'll need to compile the `.ts` files into `.js` files.
    ```bash
    npx tsc
    ```
    _(Note: If you have a `watch` script in `package.json`, you might run `npm run watch` to automatically compile on changes.)_

### Running the Application

Open the `src/index.html` file in your web browser. There isn't a dedicated development server setup by default in the provided files, but for simple front-end projects, opening the HTML file directly usually works.

## Upcoming Features

I'm actively working on enhancing this Todo List application. Here are some features that will be implemented soon:

- **Edit Task**: Ability to modify existing tasks.
- **Delete Task**: Option to remove tasks from the list.
- **Complete Task**: Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- **Filtering Options**: Filter tasks by "All", "Active", or "Completed".
- **User Interface Improvements**: Further refinements to the look and feel.
